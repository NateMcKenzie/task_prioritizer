# Save Tasks
- Save tasks to disk
- Might be easier with a simple heap stored as an array
    - This would allow me to write a csv, each line is a task
    - File can be read line by line to rebuild the heap, this is why an array would be easier.

# Update tasks
- **Time spent** critical for usefuleness of app
- Other details should be editable as well.

# Figure out how to get something besides chrome working
- Works fine, but is not my target, need to fix my dev environment.
